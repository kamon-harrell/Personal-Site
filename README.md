# Personal-Site
This is the rework of my personal site, and will also be my portfolio site.
You will find here a collection of my personal blog posts, as well as the project's
I have created and worked on in the past. This will eventually be hosted, so theres no install directions.
I plan on making this with React, ES6, Express, Babel, Webpack, and maybe some other JS technologies.
Thank you for visiting the repo, and for comparison, here is a link to the first website i created for myself http://kamon-harrell.github.io/
